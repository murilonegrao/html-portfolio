<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Diligent, innovative, idealistic, problem-solving focused, and always good-humored—these would be apt descriptors of me. Additionally, I am a husband, father of three, and I thoroughly enjoy spending time with my family.</p>
<p>At work, I always strive to find solutions, seldom dwelling on problems. I thrive in the learning zone and have a certain impatience with the comfort zone. I am consistently willing to assist colleagues, thriving in a relaxed work environment.</p>
<p>While I have my qualities, I can be a bit stubborn at times, preferring to do things my way, and I do make mistakes. However, I approach them with humility, acknowledging and rectifying them promptly, recognizing them as opportunities for growth.</p>
<p>Having spent 14 years in the Judiciary, I have worked across various areas—from processing appeal documents and analyzing criminal cases at the appellate level to conducting internal audits and dealing with public procurements in different capacities. I have been involved in drafting terms of reference, revising them, handling contracts, and seeking legal solutions for administrative actions. I have also served as an on-call duty officer and, recently, have found a fulfilling intersection of my legal knowledge with information systems and automation.</p>
<p>Trained as a legal professional but with a developer's heart, I've found myself in the right place where I can create systems that contribute to legal problem-solving. My practical marketing experience enables me to prioritize the client, focusing on usability and user experience, while enhancing my persuasive writing and storytelling skills.</p>
<p>I am straightforward, practical, thoughtful, and am working on overcoming my fear of making mistakes—embracing them as the fastest route to success. Immersed in Stoicism, I aim to refine myself each day, aspiring to leave a lasting impact and contribute as much as possible.</p>
<p>I've come to understand that the more I serve, the more I am served, and the greater the rewards when I help others. My strongest passion lies in my family, and I wouldn't trade that for anything; I thoroughly cherish the time spent with them.</p>
